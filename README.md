### Description

This code is GREAT, Have you ever sat there at work and thought 'I Could Really Use A Coffee Break, but....my boss is just around the corner'? Well this code is the thing for you!! What it does is: you select the dialog you would like to appear set a time it should be on the screen for and there you are.... you could have a fake scandisk that'll conveniently last for however long you want (while you have a coffee)!

----

Oh and please please pleas Vote for me no matter how good/bad you think this code is.... it'll help me to improve future versions + it lets me know how i'm doing in VB =)
